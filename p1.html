<h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
<p>We can say that AI was exciting, but we didn't say what was in it.this Figure shows eight definitions of AI in two dimensions. The definitions at the top concern thought processes and reasoning, while those at the bottom address behavior. The definitions on the left measure success in terms of fidelity to human performance, while the rationality of those on the right measure is measured against the ideal performance measure called rationality. The system is rational if it does the "right thing" because of what it knows.
