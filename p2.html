<h2>History of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>The origin of artificial intelligence lies in the earliest days of machine computations. During the 1940s and 1950s, AI begins to grow with the emergence of the modern computer. Among the first researchers to attempt to build an intelligent program were newell and Simon. Their first well-known program, logic theorist, was a program that proved statements using the accepted rules of logic and problem-solving program of their design. By the late fifties, programs existed that could do a passable job of translating technical documents, and it was seen as only a matter of different databases and more computing power to apply the techniques to less formal, more ambiguous texts. Most problem-solving works revolved around the work of Newell, Shaw, and Simon, on the general problem solver (GPS). Unfortunately, the GPS didn't fulfill its promise because of some simple lack of computing capacity .in the 1970s, the most important concept of AI developed known as an expert system with exhibits as a set rule the knowledge of an expert. The application area of the expert system is very large. The 1980s saw the development of neural networks as a method for learning examples.</p>
